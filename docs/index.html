    <h1>Maze for Raspberry Pi with Sense HAT</h1>
    <a id="introduction" />

    <p>
      Maze for Raspberry Pi with Sense HAT is a simple game originally
      designed for running on the <span class="define-term">Raspberry
      Pi</span><a class="citation" href="#cite1">1</a> equipped with
      the <span class="define-term">Sense HAT</span><a
      class="citation" href="#cite2">2</a> add-on board.  The ball is
      controlled by the Sense HAT's gyroscope and accelerometer
      sensors.  As a special algorithmic design feature, the maze
      labyrinth's walls are shaped with mathematical specifications
      based on implicit curves.  Hence, this project is also a plea
      for use of implicit curves.
    </p>

    <h2>Implicit curves</h2>
    <a id="implicit_curves" />

    <p>
      An <span class="define-term">implicit curve</span> defines — as
      opposed to an explicit curve as in a <span
      class="define-term">function</span> — a set of points in terms
      of an equation's set of solutions.  Implicit curves are
      relatively seldom used in software, specifically when written in
      an imperative language.  Among the few usages of implicit curves
      in computer software, there is worth of mentioning <span
      class="name">D.E.Knuth</span>'s <span
      class="define-term">METAFONT</span><a class="citation"
      href="#cite3">3</a> language, a descriptive language that
      deploys implicit curves to describe the shape of font
      characters.  Similarly, in vector graphics representation,
      implicit curves often play a central role.  One could imagine
      that implicit curves compare to explicit curves somewhat like
      functional programming to imperative programming: The entities
      of consideration are expressed in a descriptive manner rather
      than in a programmatic manner, that is, purely in terms of the
      outcome (“what”) without defining the explicit order of actions
      (“how”).
    </p>

    <p>
      This maze game features implicit curves for a very similar
      purpose.  Drawing the walls on the game's playing field boils
      down on testing if a screen pixel is inside the region defined
      by an implicit curve.  In fact, it turns out, that even
      computing a ball's reflection on a curved wall boils down to
      considering the normal vector of the curve's partial derivations
      and adjusting the direction of the ball's movement by the
      difference of the ball's previous direction and the curved
      wall's normal vector.  This approach is highly superior compared
      to “classic” approaches like computations with sobel operators,
      which, in practice, tremendously suffer from pixel aliasing.  In
      contrast, implicit curves offer — just like vector graphics —
      the chance of resolution only limited by the processor's
      numerical capabilities.
    </p>

    <h2>Implementation</h2>
    <a id="implementation" />

    <p>
      For most projects — especially when it comes to complex data
      structures as well as graphics — I prefer a modern, high-level
      language like Java.  However, for implementing this maze game, I
      finally chose C++ as core language with Qt5 as GUI toolkit for
      mainly three reasons:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        The software needs to access the Sense HAT's hardware.  While
        there is a <span class="define-term">Python</span><a
        class="citation" href="#cite4">4</a> library available
        especially for this purpose, I did not want to rely on an
        interpreted script language for the whole software just
        because of that single library.
      </li>
      <li>
        Parts of the software are somewhat performance critical.
        While, as of today, Java offers a performance approximating
        that of lower level languages like C++, the latter still gives
        me more control e.g. over data layout, volatility of data, and
        the time of freeing memory.
      </li>
      <li>
        In C++, I use Qt5 as GUI toolkit, which I expect to more
        smoothly integrate with the underlaying hardware.  I suspect
        it to eventually provide better performance especially when it
        comes to graphics hardware acceleration features (though I may
        be wrong with this assumption).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <a id="history" />

    <p>
      Almost simultaneously with the launch of the Raspberry Pi Sense
      HAT, a tiny <span class="define-term">Marble Maze</span><a
      class="citation" href="#cite5">5</a> game was published in order
      to demonstrate the new Sense HAT's capabilities.  While this
      Python based program consists of just 55 LOC (counting without
      empty lines), it is very primitive.  In particular, it
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        considers data from the gyroscope and acceleration sensors as
        binary, i.e. it does not consider gradations of velocity,
      </li>
      <li>
        consequently supports only 8 different ball movements
        (horizontal, vertical and diagonal),
      </li>
      <li>
        does not consider ball reflections when hitting a wall,
      </li>
      <li>
        simply uses the Sense HAT's 8×8 LED matrix as graphics
        display, and
      </li>
      <li>
        uses a single, hard-coded labyrinth as playing field.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      While this little demonstration program deploys basic
      functionality of many of the Sense HAT's sensors, I thought it
      would be nice to get even more out of the sensors and implement
      a more elaborated version of a maze game.  My effort resulted in
      the implementation provided with this repository.
    </p>
