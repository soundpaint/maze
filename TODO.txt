* Limit velocity, such that ball moves at most 1 pixel per time step.
* Overhoul concept when passing position (x, y) as double or integer.
* Move velocity correction code from class Balls to class Ball.
* Create template class for handling matrices.
* Consider geometry of holes.
* Create window icon / splash screen programmatically.
* Enhance accurateness of collision detection.
* Enhance accurateness of reflection and frictional resistance.
* Create sound output.
* Support perspective drawing of walls.
* Support multiple levels.
* Support multiple games.
* Create fast booting framework, maybe something similar to BerryBoot.

Done:
* Complete 1st version of collision detection.
* Let ball geometry support left/right and up/down extension.
* Fix memory leaks when using Point_3D.
* Consider geometry of balls.
